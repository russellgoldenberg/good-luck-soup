	<h2 class='explainer-hed'>A transmedia documentary</h2>
	<p>
		Good Luck Soup is a transmedia documentary project on the journey of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians before, during, and after World War II.
	</p>
 	<p>
		Told through both a traditional film and an interactive documentary, the feature film tells the story of one Japanese American family, while the interactive film tells the stories of many.
	</p>
	<h2 class='explainer-hed'>The interactive film</h2>
	<p>
		Good Luck Soup Interactive is a collection of stories on the Japanese American and Japanese Canadian experience that have been uploaded from the public and gathered by our team.
 	</p>
 	<p>
		Individual stories from different people, places and times unfold in a series of seven chapters that when viewed together reflect the universal themes of immigration, integration and identity.
	</p>
 	<p>
		This format allows us to showcase the diverse experience of those with Japanese ancestry and to educate a broad audience on their unique history and identity within American and Canadian culture.
	</p>
 	<p>
		Good Luck Soup Interactive updates this shared experience by actively collecting stories, photographs and information through self-uploaded submissions and curated content. Allowing the continuous flow of stories and submissions enables our story to change along with the evolving identity of those with Japanese heritage in the United States and Canada.

	<p>
		For 29-year-old filmmaker Matthew Hashiguchi, growing up half-Japanese American in an Irish-Catholic neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, was a difficult experience. His inability to blend in with the predominantly White population of his surroundings translated into his own personal struggles with race, and in Good Luck Soup we join Matthew on a journey to discover how Japanese heritage influenced the lives of his Japanese American family members; before, during and after World War II.
