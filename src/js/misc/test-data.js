	'text': '<p>My parents would take our family to the Cleveland shores of Lake Erie a few times each summer.  The shores closer to the tennis courts were rocky, the beaches were a few miles east or west of the city.  One of the things that I remember was that Beverly and I were interested to fish and that grandfather always had fish hooks mixed in with coins in our car\'s ashtray.  So on a few occasions he would tie a cotton string to one of the hooks, put a hot dog on the end and drop it into the water for us to hold.  We never caught a fish but it consumed our energy and kept us quiet.   This photograph was taken by my dad in September 1960.</p>',

Immediately, an African American woman said, “You can’t sit there.”</p><p>“Why?” my grandmother asked. “It’s all empty.”</p><p>Just then, a white woman grabbed her hand and led her to a seat in the middle of the bus.</p><p>I always found it interesting that the woman decided to place an Asian American in the middle of the bus, rather than the front or back.</p>',

It\'s odd, but Mitich reminded me a lot of my own father, even though they were so different. Same wiry build and attitude, never drank or smoked much, and both died early from heart issues. But both stubborn and eccentric in their own way.</p><p>The story goes like this. It was right after our wedding reception, and of course everyone was filled with a few drinks and the overall joy from the event. So as we were leaving the reception, I went up to Mitch, my new father-in-law to say thanks for everything, and I said, "Well, I guess since I am family now, I will have to learn how to play tennis." He gave me akind of a funny sneery smile and said, "You? Tennis? Too uncoordinated. Take up Golf!" But I did learn to play some tennis to get by later on.</p>',
