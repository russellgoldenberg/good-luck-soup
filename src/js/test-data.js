	'content': 'My parents would take our family to the Cleveland shores of Lake Erie a few times each summer.  The shores closer to the tennis courts were rocky, the beaches were a few miles east or west of the city.  One of the things that I remember was that Beverly and I were interested to fish and that grandfather always had fish hooks mixed in with coins in our car\'s ashtray.  So on a few occasions he would tie a cotton string to one of the hooks, put a hot dog on the end and drop it into the water for us to hold.  We never caught a fish but it consumed our energy and kept us quiet.   This photograph was taken by my dad in September 1960.',
